                        "The Grinch" (2018) is an animated Christmas comedy film based on the 1957 Dr. Seuss book "How the Grinch Stole Christmas!" and serves as the third screen adaptation of the story, following the 1966 television special and the 2000 live-action film. The movie tells the story of the Grinch, a cynical and misanthropic creature who lives in solitude atop Mount Crumpit with only his loyal dog, Max, for company. Disliking the festive spirit of the nearby town of Whoville, the Grinch devises a plan to ruin Christmas for the Whos by stealing all of their decorations, presents, and holiday feast. However, his scheme is complicated when he encounters Cindy Lou Who, a young girl with a heart of gold who believes there's more to Christmas than just material possessions.
